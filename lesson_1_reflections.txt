How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that 
was introduced?

It showed where the change happened, and so helped pinpoint the location of the
bug.

how could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

Can easily revert to a working version if a new version contains a bug.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like yo do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
Docs does?

Pros of manually choosing to commit:
	-Gurantees that the commits will contain complete and logical changes that
	make sense(if done right).
Cons:
	-The programmer may sometimes forget to commit.
