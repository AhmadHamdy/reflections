When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
To share my work with other people or to let others work on it.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
 stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

An automatic pull may cause confusion. Imagine working on a project, going for a break
, only to come back to find out that all your code was erased or heavily modified by
someone else.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one 
instead of another?

Fork: It is when you tell github to create a copy from a remote repository made by
 someone else and create an identical remote repository for you.
Clones: When you create a copy from a remote repo to a local repo, or from a local
repo to a local repo

Branches: A branch is a course of commits. Creating different branches from the 
main master branch allows you to test experimental stuff without messing up the main
stable code.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored 
locally?

It's like a screenshot of the remote repo. It helps to show if you are not in sync
with the remote repo

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier
and what would be harder?

I would upload the files somewhere and send the links to every person working 
on the project. Keeping in sync would be hard, and keeping track of files
or restoring to older versions would be harder.
