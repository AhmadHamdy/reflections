When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
To share my work with other people or to let others work on it.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
 stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

An automatic pull may cause confusion. Imagine working on a project, going for a break
, only to come back to find out that all your code was erased or heavily modified by
someone else.
